If I pass them a key that is not in the container:
 - upper_bound will return the iterator to the first element with key that's larger than the given key
 - lower_bound will give the same iterator, which refers to where we can insert the given key without ruining the order
 - equal_range will give a pair of iterators, of which the first and second elements are the same iterator, refering to 
first element with key that's larger than the given key.
