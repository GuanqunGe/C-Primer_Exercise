1) Set is a type of associative container, so it does not support position-specific operations like sequential containers do, such as push_back(), push_front(). Also as associative container, set does not allow constructor and insertion operation that takes an integer of count and an element value.
   
   List as sequential container, does allow operations mentioned above.

2) Set has keys as its elements, and keys have to be specific, no duplicates allowed.

   Elements in lists can have duplicate, since they are accessed through iterators which are unique for every element.
