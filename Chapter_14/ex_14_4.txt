(a) %: nonmember function, it's a symmetric operator

(b) %=: member function, it's a compound-assignment

(c) ++: member function, as either as a post-increment or a pre-increment, it changes the 
state of object this operator is called on

(d) ->: member function, because it's a "member" access arrow.

(e) <<: nonmember function, built-in version is a bit-shift operator, which yields a copy of 
the left operand with bit shifted to the left, so it does not change its operands. And it's 
a symmetric operator.

(f) &&: logical AND, nomember function, as it's symmetric operator

(g) ==: equality operator, nonmember function, as it's symmetric operator

(h) (): function call operator, must be defined as members.
