I guess it should, just like the pointers, sometimes we would like to know if the object is associated with any thing/tree
 and if there is a conversion from the Tree type to bool, that can be helpful. And the conversion operator should be explicit, 
to avoid potential problem of binary shift as just the example shown in this section.
