No, Tree class don't need copy/move assignment.

B/c members of tree class are either built-in type, or well-defined class type, and Tree class 
doesn't request memory from heap, so synthesized copy constructor and copy assignment, destructor 
work well for Tree class.
And since Tree class does not define any of the copy-control member function, and also that every 
nonstatic member of Tree class can be moved, the compiler will synthesize the move constructor and 
move assignment as well
