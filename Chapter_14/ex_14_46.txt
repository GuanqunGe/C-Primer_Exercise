i think converting Sales_data to std::string is not a good idea, given that Sales_data class has an nonexplicit 
constructor that takes std::string, the conversion operator will probably never be used implicitly. Also, converting Sales_data 
to std::string does have actual meaning or benefit.

Converting Sales_data to double can be somewhat useful, when you want to add different Sales_data object together with 
other doubles to calculate the total revenue (but only when doubles are in the expression, if we simply add Sales_data objects 
together, that's not gonna work and you will get unexpected result). So it's better to define double conversion as explicit, but 
then it'd be cumbersome to use. thus things will be easier and clearer to use/understand if we just define a member function that 
returns revenue member.
