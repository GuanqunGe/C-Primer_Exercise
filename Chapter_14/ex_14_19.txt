No, because there is no logical reason for < operator.
For tree, potentially we could sort them based on their age followed by type, but there is a high chance that 
there are two trees with the same type and same age, but coming from different places, and having different names, 
in this case, neither is smaller than the other, but they are not equal, which is not in line with our expectation.
