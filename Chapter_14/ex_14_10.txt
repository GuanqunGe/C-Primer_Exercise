input operator expects: string, unsigned integer, double

(a) is expected input, will work normally, bookNo - 0-201-xxx, units_sold = 10, unit_price = 24.95
(b) is not in the right form, but the program will run without error, and the status of input stream 
is good as well. However, info in the class is:  bookNo - 10, units_sold = 24, unit_price = 0.95
