In my mind, overloaded == function for string and vector looks like:
   bool operator==(const std::string &, const std::string &);
   bool operator==(const vector<T> &, const vector<T> &);
respectively.

So, (a) "cobble" == "stone" can be run successfully without <string> header, so it does not use == operator for
    string, instead it uses built-in operator.
    (b) svec1[0] == svec2[0] uses overloaded == function for string
    (c) svec1 == svec2 uses overloaded == function for vector
    (d) "svec[0]=="stone" I am not sure if this actually can compile.
