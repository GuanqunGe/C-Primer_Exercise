This function doesn't check the status of input stream, so if anything wrong happened, and reading the input 
stream failed, then price will be undefined value, there is also chance that part of the input class object 
has been changed but other parts haven't been changed, thus the class object will probably generate misleading results.

If we gave this operator the data (b) in ex_14_10, then the revenue of class object will be 24*0.95, and bookNo 
of object is "10", which doesn't make sense at all
