Overloaded operator differs from built-in operator in:
1. overloaded operator operates on user-defined object type.
2. if overloaded operator is a member function of a class, it has one fewer parameter than its operands.
3. overloaded operator can be called either indirectly as the built-in operator, or directly in the same way 
as an oridinary function.
4. overloaded operator does not preserve order of evaluation and/or short-circuit evaluation as some of its 
corresponding built-in operators do.

Overloaded operators are the same as built-in operators in various aspects:
1. Overloaded operator should have consistent meaning with corresponding built-in ones.
2. Overloaded operator have the same precedence and associativity as the built-in ones.
3. Overloaded operator has to have corresponding built-in ones, but not vice versa.
