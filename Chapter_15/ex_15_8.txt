static type is the type used to declare the variable or the type of result the expression yields; static type is known at compile time.
dynamic type is the type of object in memory that the variable/expression represents; dynamic type may not be known until run time.

For non-reference and non-pointer variable, static type and dynamic type are always the same.
For reference or pointer of base class type, its static type and dynamic type can differ.
