Yes, because override and final qualifiers serve different purposes:
    - override explicitly tellls compiler that the derived class intend to override corresponding function in its direct base class.
    - final indicates that derived class from this class can not override this function.
If we use override and final at the same time, it just means that this class intends to override corresponding function, and that 
classes derived from this class should not override this function.
