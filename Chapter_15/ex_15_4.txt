class Base{...};

(a) class Derived:public Derived{};
    wrong, as we can not derive a class from itself.

(b) class Derived: private Base {...};
    correct.

(c) class Derived : public Base;
    incorrect, when we declare a class without defining it, the declaration should only contain class name, not 
    the derivation list.
