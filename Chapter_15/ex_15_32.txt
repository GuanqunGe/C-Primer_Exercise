Query class only has one data member, a smart pointer member 'q'.
The compiler will synthesize default constructor, copy operation, move operation, and destructor for Query class.

1. default constructor will construct a Query object with q being nullptr.

2. copy operation will copy construct or copy assignment Query object, which member-wise copy construct or copy assgin smart pointer
to Query_base. After the copy operation, the member 'q' in the left hand operand will point to the underlying object the 'q' in right
hand operand points to, thus the user count of underlying object bound to the 'q' of right hand operand will increase by 1, while
the user count of the underlying object left hand operand's 'q' previosly points to will reduce by 1 for the copy assignment case, after 
the reduction if the user count has become 0, this object will be destroyed by calling the virtual destructor function. Version of 
destructor function depends on the dynamic type the left hand operand's 'q' previously points to. 

3. move operation will move construct or move assign Query object. After move operation, the user count of the underlying object
right hand operand points to does not change. In move assignment, if the left hand and right hand are not the same object, then 
the user count of the underlying object the left hand had previously pointed to will reduce by 1, and depending on whether it has become 0, 
this object will probably be destroyed.

4. destructor will simply destroy the shared_ptr, and if necessary destroy the underlying object 'q' has pointed to and free the memory.
