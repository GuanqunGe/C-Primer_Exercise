If the rhs member of OrQuery eval funtion returns an empty set, then insert() function on set<line_no> will not insert 
any element, same case as if hls member did so. If both lhs and rhs returned empty set, then the OrQuery eval function
will return a QueryResult with a shared_ptr pointing to an empty set.
