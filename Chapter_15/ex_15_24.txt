All base classes need virtual destructor.

If the members of base class can be deleted by synthesized destructor, then virtual destructor can just be defined as =default.
If the members of base class involves dynamic memory and dynamic memory needs to be handled/deleted by the class, then destructor
should be defined as normal destructors and defined as virtual function.
So in one setence, virtual destructor should perform the operations needed to destructor object of class type.
