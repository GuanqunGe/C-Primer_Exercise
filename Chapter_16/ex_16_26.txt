NO! 
If we explictily instantiate vector<NoDefault>, all members and member functions of vector template will be instantiated with NoDefault being the 
template arguments, including vector constructor that takes a `size_t n' argument, which constructs a vector of n value-initialized elements. However,
NoDefault class doesnot allow default initialization.
