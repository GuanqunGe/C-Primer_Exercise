No,defining specializations for debug_rep() does not affect function matching, because specialization is instantiation of the template.
In the ex_16_65.cxx, there are still only two template available, no non-template functions, and matching would be in between these two 
template (and their instantiations).

if we defined overloaded debug_rep() instead of specialization, then matching would happen between two debug_rep templates and the non-
template functions.
