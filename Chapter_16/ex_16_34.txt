template <class T> int compare (const T&, const T&);

(a) compare("hi", "world");
    illegal, two arguments passed to function compare are string literals, of which type is array of const char. Note that the 
parameter list of the function include reference to template argument, so T will be deduced as const char []. However, for the 
first argument, T is deduced as char[3], while for the second argument, T is deduced as  char[6]. Deduced types do not match!

(b) compare("bye", "dad");
    legal, similar reason as (a).
