As far as I know, they are basically the same, and can be used interchangably. The only difference is that typename is added to the language after
 templates were in widespread use, so some programmers continue to use class exclusively.

If we want to use a type member of a template type parameter, we must explicitly tell the compiler that it is a type by using the keyword typename.
