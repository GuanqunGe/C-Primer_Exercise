extern template class vector<string>;
template class vector<Sales_data>;


The first one is an instantiation declaration, telling the compiler that there is a definition of this instantiation elsewhere, so do not 
instantiate 'class vector<string>' here.
The second one is an instantiation definition, meaning 'class vector<Sales_data>' is instantiated, together with all the members of the 
class template.
