If we declares the nonvariadic version fo print after the definition of the variadic version, when call to print with more than two arguments
are made, the variadic version will be instantiated. And given that when the variadic version is defined, the non-variadic version is not in
scope, inside the function body of variadic print, it does not know the existence of nonvariadic version, so it will keep instantiating 
itself, until the parameter pack is empty, which will cause instantiation error, because print() template requires at least two arguments and
one is given.
