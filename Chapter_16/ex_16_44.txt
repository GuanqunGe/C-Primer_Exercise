(1) if g is declared as template <typename T> void g(T val);
    (a) g(i), type of T is int
    (b) g(ci), type of T is int. (top-level const is ignored)
    (c) g(i*ci), type of T is int.

(2) if g is declared as template <typename T> void g(const T&);
    (a) g(i), type of T is int
    (b) g(ci), type of T is again int. Because the function parameter is itself const, the type deduced for T will not be a const type.
    (c) g(i*ci), arithmetic expression returns rvalue of type int, so type of T is int.
