template <typename T> T calc(T, int);
template <typename T> T fcn(T, T);
double d; float f; char c;

(a) calc(c, 'c');
    legal, type of T is char. There is a promote of char to int for the second argument.

(b) calc(d, f);
    legal, type of T is double. There is a arithmetic conversion from float to int for the second argument.

(c) fcn(c, 'c');
    legal, type of T is char.

(d) fcn(d, f);
    illegal, as from d a double type is deduced while from f a float type is deduced, the deduced types don't match.
