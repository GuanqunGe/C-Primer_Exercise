syntax: std::make_shared<type>(args)

If the type is built-in type, then when initializing an object of this type in the heap with the args, conversions are allowed.
If the type is class type, then args will be used to call best-matched constructor for that class type and construct the object
in the heap.

So we can see that if we don't specify the template argument explicitly, it's impossible for the compiler to deduce the class
type from the args. And for the built-in type case, the argument deduced by the compiler might be different from what you intended
to use.
