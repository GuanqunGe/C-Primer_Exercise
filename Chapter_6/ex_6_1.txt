difference between parameter and argument:

parameter is part of the function definition, it's what will be used in the function body (sometimes parameters are not used). Parameters are wrapped up in a parameter list like declarations, when the function is called, they will be defined and initialized.

Argument is what's used to call the function, and initialize the parameters of the called function. Arguments can be an r-value, or l-value, but if they are l-value, arguments have to be defined before being used to call the function.
