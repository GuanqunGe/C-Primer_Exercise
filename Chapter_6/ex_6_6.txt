explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable, and a local static variable.

A parameter is enclosed by parentheses following function name, separated by comma. It has to be initialized by the arguments passed to the function when function is called. 

A local variable is a variable defined inside the function body between two curly braces. A local variable can be defined without initializer, but it will be default initialized.

Both parameter and local variable only exist when the function is being executed, they die when the function ends. 

A local static variable is also a variable defined inside the function body, but it's static, it's defined/initialized before the function actually being executed, and only dies when the program terminates. If a local static variable is defined without initializer, it will be value-initialized.
