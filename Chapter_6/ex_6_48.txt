string s;
while(cin >> s && s!= sought) {} //empty body
assert(cin)


The loop takes input from the keyboard until it sees an end-of-file or finds the string that equals variable sought. I don't think it's a good use of assert, because if I decided to stop typing, cin >> s will fail and the program will be terminated, which isn't being handled nicely.
assert should be used to verify things that truly should not be possible, it shouldn't be used to substitue for run-time logic checks.
