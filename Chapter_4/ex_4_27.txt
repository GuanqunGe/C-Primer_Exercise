unsigned long ul1  =3, ul2 = 7;

(a) ul1 & ul2

assume the program runs on a 32 bits unsigned long machine, then a number of 3 has 28 leading 0's and 0011, while a number of 7 has 28 leading 0's and a following 0111.

  ul1 & ul2 will have 28 leading 0's and 0011 --> a number of 3

(b) ul1 | ul2

  ul1 | ul2 will have 28 leading 0's and 0111 --> a number of 7

(c) ul1 && ul2 will return true
(d) ul1 || ul2 will return true
