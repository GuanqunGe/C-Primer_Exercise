    SomeValue ? ++x, ++y:--x, --y;

Two possible ways it could go:
    (SomeValue ? (++x, ++y):--x), --y;
Or  SomeValue ? (++x, ++y) : (--x, --y);

Now for the second one to happen, we are assuming that the comma operator (,) is strong enough to hold --x and --y together, in front of the ?: operator, but unfornately it is not.
So instead, the first possibility happens
