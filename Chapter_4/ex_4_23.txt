string s = "word";
string pl = s + s[s.size()-1] == 's' ? "" : "s";

Add operator has higher precedence than equality operator, which has higher precedence than conditional operator, so this is essentially: 

   string pl = ((s+s[s.size()-1]) == 's' ) ? "" : "s";

I would change it to:
  
   string pl = s + (s[s.size()-1] == 's' ? "" : "s");
