A constructor that takes a container to copy:
1. the container type and element type of these two must match (for arrays that means the size of the arrays must be the same too)
2. The newly constructed container will have exactly the same elements as the one it copies from

A constructor that takes two iterators:
1. the container type of two can be different, and the element type can be different too as long as the element types are convertable.
2. the newly constructed container will have the same elements only as these in the iterator range.
