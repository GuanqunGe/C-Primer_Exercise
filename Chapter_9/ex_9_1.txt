(a) list is preferred for this one. As it involves inserting element in the middle of the container
(b) a deque is preffered. Since this one involves adding/removing elements at the front/back. Even though a list is capable of doing that too, list is slower than deque in removing/add elements at the front/back, and memory overhead is substantial for list.
(c) a vector is preffered. Even though a vector and a list are both capable of holding elements and having them in sorted order, vector is mush fast and less memory overhead.
