if vec holds 25 elements:
1. vec.resize(100) will expand the vec to hold 100 elements. The first 25 elements are the same as before, another 75 value-initailized elements are added to the back of vec. If element type of vec is class and doesn't have default constructor then it will throw an error.

2. vec.resize(10) will delete the last 90 elements in the vec, keep the first 10 unchanged.
