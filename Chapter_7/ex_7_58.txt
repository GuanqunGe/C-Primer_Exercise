In example.h: rate and vec shouldn't be initialized inside the class, because they are neither const integer type, nor constexpr of literal type.

In example.C:
rate and vec should be defined and initialized in example.C instead of just being defined in example.C
vecSize should also be defined in example.C, with no initialzers.
