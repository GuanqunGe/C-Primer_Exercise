When a StrBlob object is destroyed, shared_ptr 'data' will be destroyed, and the 
use count of dynamically allocated object that 'data' member points to will reduce 
by 1, if the use count becomes 0, that object will be destroyed and momeory will be 
freed. 
e
When a StrBlobPtr object is destroyed, its two data members will both be destroyed. 
Since weak_ptr does not affect the use count of the object it's bound to, when 
weak_ptr is destroyed, nothing happens to the object bounded to it.
