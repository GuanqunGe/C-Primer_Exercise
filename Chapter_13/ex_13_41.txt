Because first_free is meant to point to one pass the last (constructed) element,
so essentially what push_back should do is to first, construct an object in the 
address first_free currently points to, then move first_free one step forward,
such that we add an element at the back of the sequence, and first_free still points 
to one past the last element

If we use the prefix increment, there will be two problem:
1. we are not adding element to the back of the sequence, instead the newly added 
element and the (previously) last element in the sequence will be separated by one
memory space that's enough to hold a string, which is still raw!
2. first_free will not point to the address one pass the last element in the sequence,
instead it will point to the last element.
