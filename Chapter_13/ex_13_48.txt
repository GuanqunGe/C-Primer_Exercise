vec.push_back(value) involves 2 to 3 steps
- construct a temporary object, given value
- construct a new element, based on the temporary object. 
- or, if space is not enough, reallocate the vector, copy over all existingelement, 
and then construct a new element based on the temporary object

From what I see:
- constructors used to construct temporary object depends on 
the argument you give to push_back().
- construction of new element is through copy constructor
- At least with class String, reallocate the vector involves copy-constructing
elements in the new address from the ones in the old address, instead of 'moving'
/transfering the ownership.
