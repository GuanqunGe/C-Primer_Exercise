The parameter is 'Folder&' because we don't want to add messages to a local copy of 'Folder', and 
that we would like to change the member of 'Folder' inside the function.

1) If we use 'Folder', then we'd be adding address of local copy of 'Folder' to the 'folders' member
of messages, and also adding messages to the local copy of 'Folder', however this local copy of 'Folder'
will be destroyed when the function finishes.

2) If we use 'const Folder &', then we wouldn't be able to modify the data member of argument 'Folder'.
