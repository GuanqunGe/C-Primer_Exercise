Destructor is a function that does whatever it needs to do to free the resources 
used by the object and destroys the nonstatic data members of the object. Destructor 
has a tilde in front of it, and it does not take any argument.

Synthesized destructor has an empty function body, and destroys all nonstatic data 
members during the implicit destruction phase after the execution of function body.

Synthesized destructor is synthesized during compilation if the class does not define 
its own destructor.
