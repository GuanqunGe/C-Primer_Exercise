If Message uses the synthesized version of the copy-control member:
1) for copy constructor, the newly created object will have the same content, and point 
to the same folders, but will not have relavant folders pointing it back

2) for the copy-assignment, after the assignment, the left-hand object will have the same
content and point to the same folders as the right-hand object, however, it will not have 
the right set of folders pointing back to itself. The folders that point back to the left-hand 
object will be the folders associated with its previous content.

3) for the destructor, similar problem here. The content and pointers to relavant folders will 
be deleted, ie the whole object is destructed, but there is still pointers in Folder object that
points to this memory, which will probably cause errors when the Folder object is destructed.
