When we assign one StrBlob to another, the member 'data' of the left operand will be 
copy-assigned from the 'data' member of the right-hand object, so essentially members 
of these two operand will point to the same address in the memory.

When we assign one StrBlobPtr to another, the 'curr' member and 'weakptr' member both will be 
copy-assigned. So after the assignment, 'weakptr' members of two operands shares the ownership
of an address in the memory.
