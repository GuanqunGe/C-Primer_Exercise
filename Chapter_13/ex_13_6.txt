A copy operator is a member function of the class object, with function name 'operator=',
and takes an argument of the same type as the class object. It usually returns the
reference to its left operand. 

This operator is used when we copy assignment a class object using '='

Synthesized copy-assignment operator basically assigns all non-static members of the right 
operand object to the corresponding member of the left operand, using the copy assignment 
operator for the type of each non-static member.

Synthesized copy-assignment operator is synthesized during compilation.
