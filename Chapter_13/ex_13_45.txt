We can bind an lvalue reference to any variable/expressions that have the same type as the reference,
and that are not temporary, with one exception that we can bind lvalue reference to const to temporary
object of the same type.

We can only bind rvalue reference to literal or expressions that yield rvalue, or bind rvalue reference
to variable that has different type as the rvalue reference.
