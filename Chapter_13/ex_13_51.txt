unique_ptr is a type, and when it's is returned by a function, what's returned is 
a temporary object copy-constructed from the expression given in return statement. 
While copy construction can use either copy constructor or move constructor, 
unique_ptr does not have copy constructor nor copy assignment. So it's possible that 
unique_ptr has only two constructors: regular constructor, and move constructor, as 
it does not define copy constructor, copy constructor and copy assignment operator 
are deleted.


* Though, I don't see how the local variable of type unique_ptr inside the function 
body can be temporary and thus bind to a rvalue reference..

* I found one answer from others: https://github.com/jaege/Cpp-Primer-5th-Exercises/blob/master/ch13/13.51.md
 But I am not satisfied with it either
