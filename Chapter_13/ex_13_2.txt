Sales_data::Sales_data(Sales_data rhs);

This is a copy constructor, its functionality is to construct an object using (reference to ) another object of the same type. Now the argument is a 'Sales_data' type, so we need to copy construct the parameter, this will trigger a call to the same copy constructor whose parameter initialization will trigger another call to the copy constructor and so on. And this loop will not end.
