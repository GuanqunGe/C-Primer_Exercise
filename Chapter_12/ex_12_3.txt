//My guess is wrong.
//The compiler actually allows a const push_back() or pop_back() function for StrBlob class
//I think the correct answer is here: https://github.com/jaege/Cpp-Primer-5th-Exercises/blob/master/ch12/12.3.md

My guess:
NO, because when we define a object of const class type, all the members in the object are considered const. So member 'data' of const StrBlob object is a smart pointer which can't modify its underlying object. So we can't call push_back() or pop_back() function through this 'data' pointer, so there is no need to have a const version of push_back() and pop_back() member function.
