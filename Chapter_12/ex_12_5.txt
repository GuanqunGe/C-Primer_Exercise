Pros:
1. the functionality of StrBlob is very similar to that of std::vector, so allowing implicit construction imitates the list initialization of vectors too. 

Cons:
1. implicit conversion is not as clear as direct initialization, especially when we are dealing with containers of StrBlob type or functions whose parameters are StrBlob type.
