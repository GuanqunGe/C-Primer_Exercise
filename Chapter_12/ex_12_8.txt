bool b(){
    int* p = new int;
    //...
    return p;
}

// p is a built-in pointer that points to a dymanic memory
// return type of b is a boolean, so it will alway return true, as p is not a nullptr
// but after executon of function b, p will be out of scope, and we lost the pointer to 
// the dynamically allocated memory which is not freed.
