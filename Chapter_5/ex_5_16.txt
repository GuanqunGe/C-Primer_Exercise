For loop:

    for(decltype(vec.size()) i =0; i != vec.size(); i++) {....}

While loop:
    std::string str;
    while(cin >> str) {....}


Use the other loop construct to re-write these loops:

    decltype(vec.size()) i=0;
    while( (i++) != vec.size()){...}


    for(std::string str; cin>> str; ){...}

If I can use only one loop, I will use for loop, because it has three elements: init-statement, condition, and expression, so I can define variables at the beginning of for loop without worrying about unuseful variables wasting resources after the loop.
