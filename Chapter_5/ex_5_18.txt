(a) do-while has a block of statments, should use curly braces:
    do{
	int v1, v2;
        cout << "Pleae enter two numbers to sum: ";
        if(cin >> v1 >> v2)
	    cout << "The sum is : " << v1+v2 << endl;
    }while(cin);

(b) do {
	//....
    }while(int ival = get_response());

    Condition statement shouldn't have initialization/definition in it. 

(c) do{
        int ival = get_response();
    }while(ival);

   In the condition, ival is already out-of-scope.
   Variable used in the condition should be defined outside of the do-while body.
