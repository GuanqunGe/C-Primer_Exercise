(a) for (int ix = 0; ix!=sz; ++ix) {/*... */}
    if(ix != sz)  //....

    ix is defined at the start of for loop, so it's out of scope after the for loop.

(b) int ix;
    for(ix != sz; ++ix) {/* ... */}

   This for loop is missing init statement, should be for( ; ix!=sz; ++ix){/* .. */} if ix is initialized before, or for(ix=xxx; ix!=sz; ++ix){...}


(c) for (int ix = 0; ix!=sz; ++ix, ++sz) {/*...*/}
   
    if at the first iteration, ix!=sz is satisfied, then this loop will never end.
